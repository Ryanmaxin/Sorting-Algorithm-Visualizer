## Sorting Algorithm Visualizer:

*Born from a deep-seated fascination with sorting algorithms, this visualizer tool transforms abstract computational theories into captivating visual animations. Designed to make complex concepts accessible and engaging, it brings the intricate dance of algorithms to life, offering both novices and seasoned programmers a vivid glimpse into the mechanics of data sorting.*

A website that allows the user to visualize sorting algorithms. The sort type, animation speed, array size, and pivot selection (for quicksort) can all be interacted with. This website was built in react, and makes use of material ui to style some components.

### How to Run

Simply go to: https://ryanmaxin.github.io/Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer/

#### Current Sorts include:

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

## Reflection

This was a on-off project I worked on for over two months in my free time. The main goal of this project was to help me build and solidify knowledge of many of the most common sorting algorithms.

Ultimitely I found myself also learning a ton about the call stack, as I had to use asynchronous JavaScript extensively to properly animate the sorting. This project was also the first website I attempted to create a professional, visually pleasing user interface. I personally planned out the design and spent countless hours making sure the website followed this plan and stayed responsive for all screen sizes. 

I spent a lot more time then I ideally would have liked styling the Material UI elements (it was my first time implementing them). I also had difficulty scaling the text to fit the "about" div as screen sizes grew or shrank. In the end I was able to fix all of these issues and I gained experience with how to deal with them for the future. Overall I am very happy how this project turned out, and hope any one reading this can get some value out of too!
